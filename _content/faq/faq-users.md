# How do I get the license for Oskari?

The source code for Oskari is open source. It is being kept flexible in order to broaden it with new components, use it with different service platforms and for changing the software libraries if needed. The UI supports multilingualism and there are already multiple languages translated. All source code is being published with [MIT/EUPL licenses](https://github.com/oskariorg/oskari-docs/blob/master/documents/LICENSE-MIT.txt).

# How much does Oskari cost?

The open source code is available free of charge! Oskari saves time and money.

# How do I create embedded maps from Oskari?

If you don’t want to set up Oskari installation, don’t worry you can still enjoy the ride. You can build fancy & tailored map views based on Published maps functionality in Oskari. This requires an Oskari installation that has enabled the Published map functionality. If you are registered to the Oskari site you want to use, add the map layers you need to the map and click Published maps. Follow the instructions and embedd the iframe code you get in the end to your website.

# Why are there no layers in an embedded map?

Check access rights. It might be that users with guest-role (most of the people looking at embedded maps) don't have permission to see layers included in the embedded map. [See Oskari permissions](/documentation/docs)

# How do I tailor my embedded maps?

Embedded maps can be tweaked to be in contact with your web site and provide more information to users using code snippets called RPC (Remote Process Call). So you can get the map to talk with your site. See the RPC example codes or follow the workshop example.
