# Karttapaikka

The service provides access to the Land Survey of Finland's cadastral maps, aerial photographs and background maps.

You can search for maps of the whole of Finland by place names and coordinates. In more detailed scales, the maps also show the property division (property boundaries and property identifiers).

Users can also download geospatial data and purchase printed maps and customised map prints. The area, size and scale of your own map printout are freely selectable.

## Who is the map service for?

The service is open and free of charge for everyone, and no registration is required to use it.
